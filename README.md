## **2. Features Overview**
### **🔹 Secure Login & Registration**
- **Register** with a **username** and **7-digit PIN**.
- **Real-time validation** ensures:
  - "Please enter a PIN" when a PIN is missing.
  - "Pins do not match" when PINs are inconsistent.
  - "A PIN must be exactly 7 digits" when the format is incorrect.
- Securely **stores JWT tokens** with expo-secure-store.

✅ **Example Login Flow**:
[Login Screen] User: "Enter username & PIN" App: "Welcome back, badgerFan!"

---

### **🔹 Dynamic Chatroom Management**
- **View all available chatrooms**, dynamically retrieved from the API.
- Uses **React Navigation Drawer** for easy chatroom switching.
- Implements **FlatList pull-to-refresh** for real-time message updates.

✅ **Example Chatroom View**:
[Union South Socials]

Alice: "Game night at 7PM!"
Bob: "See you there!"

---

### **🔹 Creating & Posting Messages**
- Users can **create posts** inside chatrooms using a **modal interface**.
- Requires **both a title & message content** (button disabled otherwise).
- Shows a **confirmation alert** when the post is successfully created.

✅ **Example Post Creation**:
> **User:** "Create a post in Lakeshore Lounge"  
> **App:** "Enter title & content"  
> **User:** "Title: Game Night!"  
> **User:** "Content: Who wants to join for board games at 7PM?"  
> **App:** "Post successfully created!"  

---

### **🔹 Deleting Posts**
- Users **can delete their own posts**, but **not others' posts**.
- **Deletes instantly** from the UI with a confirmation alert.

✅ **Example Post Deletion**:
> **User:** "Delete my post in Lakeshore Lounge"  
> **App:** "Post successfully deleted!"  

---

### **🔹 Secure Logout**
- Removes JWT from **expo-secure-store**.
- **Redirects to login screen** after logout.

✅ **Example Logout**:
> **User:** "Log out"  
> **App:** "You have been logged out."  

---

### **🔹 Guest Mode (Anonymous Access)**
- Users can **browse chatrooms as guests**.
- **Cannot create posts** unless logged in.
- Instead of logging out, guests **are redirected to sign up**.

✅ **Example Guest Mode**:
> **User:** "Continue as guest"  
> **App:** "You are now browsing as a guest."
